### Which part(s) in your job that you find to be the most difficult?
Solving problems for the members such as
* Some members aren't satified with the service provided
> This is due to having 2 types of reservation either manually at the sport court office or online reservation via mobile phones, which is difficult for children and elderly. 

* The number of field and courts available for member is lower than the demand.
* Having to reserve the courts instead of being able to walk-in and use the court immediately.
* Having to reserve require a lot of commitment from the member.

### Has anyone who came here to use the sport field said anything about this app in particular?
* They want the reservation to be day-on-day; that is able to reserve the same day as the day they want to use to court. (The system now only allow the member to reserve and use the court next day)

### When someone make a reservation through this app, what do you have to manage in the staff side?
* The staffs need to put the data from the bank into system webapp.

### How long has this system been in use?
* This system has been in used since september last year.

### How do you feel about this system the first time you used it?
* Felt like the system is incomplete as the government staffs were and still are able to manage only 50% of the system and 50% is maintained by a private company who were contracted to develop the system
* Felt like the system is unpolished as the systems had many bugs and technical problems that were fixed only when encountered
* Felt like it doesn't align with the needs of the users
* Felt upset as when a bug or a technical problem was found, it usually took long time to be addressed and fixed by the contracted private company

### Has this app encountered any frequent problems, both member side and staff side, were you able to fix it? If so how?
[fixed] Members can open the app to see frozen blank white screen. <br>
> Fixed by notifying the backend developers at the contracted company.

[fixed] QR for payment doesn't load <br>
> Fixed by notifying the backend developers at the contracted company.

[not fixed yet] The payment status is not real-time
> The payment status doesn't automatically process the fund and accept payment immediately after payment, since it needs the staff to manage payment result from the bank api to the webapp system.

[unfixable] High OS version requirement <br>
<br>
> Note: The developers at the contracted company tend to have slow respond time.

### What are the parts of the current version of the CSTD app that you see as beneficial and useful?
* The members don't have to come to the court just to make a reservation, this eliminates the problem that members might argue because of queue order
* The members don't have to come to the court just to make a reservation, this save them from coming to the court only to find out that the court is full for the day this can infuriate the member

### Has any member ever told you what parts of the current version of the app is useful to them?
* They like that they can make a reservation online and don't have to queue up in a line at the office
* They like that they don't need to pay for the service in cash

How would you rate this app from the scale of 1 to 5 and why?
* 4/5
* The system cannot work automatically as human intervention is still require as stated in staff daily activities

If you can change anything in this app what would you change?
* Adding feature to reserve on the same day as using the court
* Making the system automatic with less human intervention

If this app were to change what would you keep the same?
* Be able to pay for reservation online with quick bank money transfer 
* Allowing the member to reserve the court as it was the initial purpose of the app

Have you used this app as a member? Please tell me your experience and how often do you use the app.
* Think positively because they can see if the court is fully reserved or still open beforehand unlike walk-in reservation.
* Use the app daily to assist with staff duty by checking the integrity of the reservation data
* Use to reserve a court normally sometimes

Have there been any systems prior to this? If so, how do both of them differ from each other? What do the staffs prefer?
* There was never any systems that allow member to reserve the courts remotely
* There was only a reservation system that operate only at the office which used Microsoft access
> Worked by scanning the citizen card and it will print out a reservation card.
* The staffs view both as being good in their own rights.
> Access helps improve management and reporting, but members have to reserve at the office
> CSTD Let members reserve from anywhere and not have to pay in cash, but makes it harder to manage and report as the revenue needs to be separated from online transfer and cash before reporting
