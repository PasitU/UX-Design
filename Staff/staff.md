Solving problems for the members such as

* The number of field and courts available for member is lower than the demand.
* Having to reserve the courts instead of being able to walk-in and use the court immediately.
* Having to reserve require a lot of commitment from the member.

### Has anyone who came here to use the sport field said anything about this app in particular?

### How do you feel about this system the first time you used it?
* Felt like the system is incomplete as the government staffs were and still are able to manage only 50% of the system and 50% is maintained by a private company who were contracted to develop the system
* Felt like the system is unpolished as the systems had many bugs and technical problems that were fixed only when encountered
* Felt like it doesn't align with the needs of the users
* Felt upset as when a bug or a technical problem was found, it usually took long time to be addressed and fixed by the contracted private company

### Has this app encountered any frequent problems, both member side and staff side, were you able to fix it? If so how?
[fixed] Members can open the app to see frozen blank white screen. <br>
> Fixed by notifying the backend developers at the contracted company.

> Fixed by notifying the backend developers at the contracted company.

[unfixable] High OS version requirement <br>
<br>
> Note: The developers at the contracted company tend to have slow respond time.

### What are the parts of the current version of the CSTD app that you see as beneficial and useful?
* The members don't have to come to the court just to make a reservation, this eliminates the problem that members might argue because of queue order
* The members don't have to come to the court just to make a reservation, this save them from coming to the court only to find out that the court is full for the day this can infuriate the member
* 

### Has a member ever told you what parts of the current version of the app is useful to them?
